#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
I really liked seeing actual examples of code that we will be working on before jumping into the challenges. Pair-working also helps me with talking out the problems. Jez did a great job on presenting and helping me out when I go stuck. Thank you Jez!!
