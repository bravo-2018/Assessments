### Week 1 Assessment

These are potential interview questions. Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online.

#### 1. One great resource for learning Javascript is Eloquent Javascript - read this chapter on functions (http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) and list a few thoughts, questions, or things you learned here:

  //Your List
1) Opening quote was pretty funny 
2) I like how he explained closure and how the variables dont leak out at the end of every functions
3) At one point he said "But just as weâ€™re in the process of copying and pasting those four lines one more time, we stop and reconsider" and I felt that multiple times this week lol

#### 2. What is a linter for? Do you think they are usefull? Explain why/why not.

// your answer
A linter is a program that checks your code for potential bugs. I think they are useful because they'll most likely catch the little mistakes developers are likely to gloss over

#### 3. Explain local vs global scope in programming. Feel free to create a code example to support your answer.

  //Your Answer
  Global scope is when something is available to be referenced to in the entire code
  Local scope is when something is only available in a specific function

  //Googled Answer
  A global variable exists only once in a script, and is visible in every function
  A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is declared in
#### 4. Another great resource for more practice writing code is Free Code Camp. Their Javascript section starts here (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code) - do at least 5 exercises.

Was this extra practice helpful? Take note of any concepts you learned or felt you understood better because of this resource.

  //Your Answer
  
  Not really

#### 5. Complete the steps for pushing changes to Github, assuming that the directory you are working in is already a git repo:

- git add .
- git commit -m "msg"
- git push -u origin master

#### 6. List some differences between return and console.log in Javascript. When would you use one vs the other?

return actually returns a value where console.log just displays it
console.log is mostly for debugging and you want to use returns to have a function return something at the end of it

#### 7. Think back to the intro to Javascript presentation. We talked about Javascript being a "Dynamically Typed" language. What did this mean about the way we write Javascript?

// Your Answer
It meant is was read as it was ran compared to other languages which require more steps

// Googled Answer
A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference). Example: Perl, Ruby, Python
