#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
I think it really helps me specifically when we get to go see other student's work when I'm stuck on mine with my partner. I learn better when the example is present and then explained to me each line by line. I also found it helpful when Jez picks our brains and goes step by step on what we need to do in question form? Not sure if that last part made any sense...but those are a couple of things that I found helpful.
