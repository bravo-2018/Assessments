#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

On Thursday, Jez did a superhero example before we went to the challenges to demonstrate scope, objects, private data and closure.  In this example, Jez built a function that we could pass arguments through - superhero name, alias, location.  She then preceded to explain how some of the information was private.  We then passed through a couple of superheroes and called the information to see how to access the private data.  Building this example on the big screen and passing through a couple of arguments really helped with the challenges for the day.
