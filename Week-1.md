### Week 1 Assessment

These are potential interview questions. Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online.

#### 1. One great resource for learning Javascript is Eloquent Javascript - read this chapter on functions (http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) and list a few thoughts, questions, or things you learned here:

  //Your List
  -bindings with let and const are local to the block that they are declared in so if declared in a loop, it only works in there
  -function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that scope
  -console.log outputs all of the values it is given
  -function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure
  -function that calls itself is called recursive, inefficient alternative to looping
  -Writing .length after a string expression will give us the length of that string


#### 2. What is a linter for? Do you think they are usefull? Explain why/why not.

// your answer
I'm not sure what a linter is for...but after googling it...
Linting is can automatically find dumb mistakes so you can fix them without thinking. It makes your code break less and less confusing.
I think it's useful because it seems like a spell check for your codes to ensure it works properly and cleans it out.

#### 3. Explain local vs global scope in programming. Feel free to create a code example to support your answer.

  //Your Answer
  Global scope can be accessed anywhere in the code. Local scope can be accessed within the function it's nested in.

  //Googled Answer
  Variables defined outside a function are [â€¦] called global variables.
  Variables defined within a function are local variables.

  var global = 10  <==global

  function fun() {
    var local = 5  <==local
  }


#### 4. Another great resource for more practice writing code is Free Code Camp. Their Javascript section starts here (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code) - do at least 5 exercises.

Was this extra practice helpful? Take note of any concepts you learned or felt you understood better because of this resource.

  //Your Answer
I find freecodecamp easy to use and understand.

#### 5. Complete the steps for pushing changes to Github, assuming that the directory you are working in is already a git repo:

- git add .
- git ________________
- git _____________ -u origin master

#### 6. List some differences between return and console.log in Javascript. When would you use one vs the other?

#### 7. Think back to the intro to Javascript presentation. We talked about Javascript being a "Dynamically Typed" language. What did this mean about the way we write Javascript?
