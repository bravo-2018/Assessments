      <p>My name is Steven Sarpy and I am currently enrolled at Learn Academy in San Diego, CA to pursue web development. I am excited about this opportunity that awaits me.
        Prior to Learn Academy, I worked as an Attorney in New Orleans, LA and Dallas, TX. I enjoy having career options and hope to encapsulate web development and legal work in a job one day.
      </p>
      <p> One reason why I am interested in learning code deals with the economy today. In the next few years, there will be a greater need for computer programmers.
        I am hoping that learning how to program today will set me up in the future for success in the job market where I am able to utilize my programming skills to get ahead in the job market.
