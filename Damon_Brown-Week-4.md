# Week 4 Assessment

Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.


#### 1. What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?
They seem to accomplish the same task but the syntax is a bit different between the two.  no curly brackets!

#### 2. What does it mean that a class inherits from another class? Try to explain Ruby inheritance.


[Your Answer] class inheritance allows child classes to take specific attributes from their parent.  This saves us programming time.


[Googled Answer]
Rather than exhaustively define every characteristic of every new class, we need only to append or to redefine the differences between each subclass and its superclass. This use of inheritance is sometimes called differential programming. It is one of the benefits of object-oriented programming.



#### 3. What is rspec and what is the general process for writing tests in RSpec?

//Your Answer
Rspec is a test which allows us to BDD means of programming.

//Googled Answer
RSpec is a great tool in the behavior-driven development (BDD) process of writing human readable specifications that direct and validate the development of your application.

#### 4. Name three possible non-inheritance relationships between ruby objects?

#### 5. What do we call the #{} convention used below? What is it accomplishing?

```ruby
x = 1022
puts "I am printing a random number #{x}"
```
string interpolation - it helps us inject data into a string.  In the above case, it's telling us to inject 1022.

#### 6. How do you feel about testing right now? What potential pros/cons/barriers/advantages do you see to implementing BDD in your own code?

//Your Answer
I like the idea of testing.  An issue I have with testing is actually writing tests.  If I know my code works it's easy for me to write a simple test for the code to pass.  However, I know it's not a strong test. if I start testing before writing code how do I know what my logic will be?

//Googled Answer
con - the time it takes to finish a project.


#### 7. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from a normal, local variable?

//Your Answer
An instance variable is a variable of something stated in a class.  We get access throughout the class whereas, local variable is only used during that context.
//Googled Answer
An instance variable has a name beginning with @, and its scope is confined to whatever object self refers to.

#### 8. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. Here is the long list of great resources: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/. Below are a few popular ones:
- Interactive Ruby tutorial (http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby: comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries (http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html)
- Ruby in 20 min (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)

Choose one of these resources and go through the material (not for hours, only looking for around 10-20min of your time) then come back here and list a few new things you learned about Ruby.

method alias is pretty cool! Ruby allows a method to be aliased, thereby creating a copy of a method with a different name (although invoking the method with either name ultimately calls the same object).

there are so many math functions I didn't know about!
