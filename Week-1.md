### Week 1 Assessment

These are potential interview questions. Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online.

#### 1. One great resource for learning Javascript is Eloquent Javascript - read this chapter on functions (http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) and list a few thoughts, questions, or things you learned here:

  //Your List


#### 2. What is a linter for? Do you think they are usefull? Explain why/why not.

A linter provides a top-level API to its consumer so that they can visualize errors and other types of messages with ease. Linters analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.  // your answer

#### 3. Explain local vs global scope in programming. Feel free to create a code example to support your answer.

  Global scope is visible in every function and can be used by all functions. Local Scope is any variable that is only accessible inside a specific function.  //Your Answer


  JavaScript has two scopes – global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions. //Googled Answer


#### 4. Another great resource for more practice writing code is Free Code Camp. Their Javascript section starts here (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code) - do at least 5 exercises.

Was this extra practice helpful? Take note of any concepts you learned or felt you understood better because of this resource.

  I previously used FCC in 2017 getting ready for the course. The website does help with practice and explaining how to arrive at certain answers well. //Your Answer

#### 5. Complete the steps for pushing changes to Github, assuming that the directory you are working in is already a git repo:

- git add .
- git ________________
- git push -u origin master

#### 6. List some differences between return and console.log in Javascript. When would you use one vs the other?
// My Answer: console.log() is a function used to print information to the console. console.log will display the parameter passed to the log method in the console window. Use this method to display a string or variable in the console window. console.log is a function that lets us inspect values for debugging purposes.

return, on the other hand, is a call to pass some value back up to where the call was made. When using the return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value. return is a statement that allows a function to output a value back to where it was called.

#### 7. Think back to the intro to Javascript presentation. We talked about Javascript being a "Dynamically Typed" language. What did this mean about the way we write Javascript?

Javascript is dynamic - meaning that we do not have to declare the data type of a variable when we create it. // Your Answer


Dynamic typed programming languages are those languages in which variables must necessarily be defined before they are used. This implies that dynamic typed languages do not require the explicit declaration of the variables before they’re used. // Googled Answer
